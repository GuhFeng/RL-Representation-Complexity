# Rethinking Model-based, Policy-based, and Value-based Reinforcement Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity

This is the repository for the paper [Rethinking Model-based, Policy-based, and Value-based Reinforcement Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17248).

We empirically examine the representation complexity of model, optimal policy, and optimal value functions in various simulated MuJoCo environments.

## Installation
Set up the environment.

```
conda env create -f env.yaml  
```

## Usage

Train the oracle policy model by TD3.

```
bash ./train_TD3.sh 
```

Generate the dataset by the policies.

```
bash ./rollout.sh
```

Compute the representation error.

```
bash ./repr_error.sh
```
